# Natural Lanuage Processing

This repo has my work for the CIS-6930 course on Natural Language Processing and Applications (NLP).
It covers a few basic and important NLP tasks:

---

## 1. Simple Tokenizer (using spaCy)

A small program that splits English text into words and sentences using spaCy’s built-in tools.

---

## 2. Sequence Labelling

Code and notes for basic sequence labeling, like:

* Assigning part-of-speech (POS) tags to each word in a sentence
* Simple approaches for learning and predicting tags

---

## 3. Document Similarity

Shows how to compare two documents and check how similar they are.
Includes basic examples using spaCy’s vectors.

---

## 4. Multilingual Semantic Role Labelling (SRL)

Some work on identifying the roles of words (like “who did what to whom”)
in sentences, including in different languages.

## Dependencies

* Python 3.7+
* spaCy
* scikit-learn
